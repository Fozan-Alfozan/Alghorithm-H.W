## my alghorithm homework
### question: write an algorithm that counts how many even numbers are in a list

note even numbers = {0,2,4,6,8, ...}

you can test ur alghorithm on this list

{5,4,3,6,7,7,1,1}


**ALGORITHM!**

**STEP ONE:** Pick out the first number on the list of numbers and divide it by two, if it turned out to not be a whole number, the skip it, if it did turn out a whole number, add it to a new list called *"the even bros"*

**STEP TWO:** After finished with the first number, continue on with the rest of the numbers on the list. When finished with all the numbers go to step three.

**STEP THREE:** All the numbers in *"the even bros"* are even numbers, and all the numbers skipped are NOT even numbers. 

**STEP FOUR:** count how many numbers there are in *"the even bros".* Then you have successfully counted all the even numbers that were already on the list.
